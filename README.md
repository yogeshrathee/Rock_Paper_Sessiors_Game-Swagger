> Modularise

For the time being I have modularise the project on package level.
Later we can also modularise in maven modules.    
    
> RESTful API design 

Backend consists RESTful APIs all starts with `/api/v1` because of following reasons:
- Api versioning can be done in future. (followed java principle: Open for extension and closed for modification)

> Trying out and documentation for RESTful APIs

Swagger is already integrated and can be used for using API instead of curl.

> Comments in code 

Entire code styling is influenced by Clean Code principle - Robert Martin
Which says
'Truth can only be found in one place: the codeâ€™.
So you may not found any comments anywhere in the project.
Keeping in mind that git can be used to versioning of file and method, class names should be kept as self explanatory.
